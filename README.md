# HyperTeX
A HexChat plugin that compiles and hyperlinks to detected TeX.

## Installation
HyperTeX requires Python 3.8+ and matplotlib which in turn uses MiKTeX with a few additional TeX dependencies.

To install this plugin, copy hypertex.py to HexChat's plugin folder. Ideally inside a folder called `hypertex`. Load the plugin via the GUI (HexChat -> Load Plugin or Script) or in HexChat with `/LOAD hypertex/hypertex.py`.
